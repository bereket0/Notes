# CSS Lecture Note

## What is CSS?

CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.

- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
- CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
- CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
- External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

## Why Use Css?

 **For Example** in this code the Style part is CSS that changes the HTML

The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.

With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

- Style sheets are made up of one or more style instructions for how page element should be displayed
- A rule says how a particular page element should be displayed.
- there are two main sections of a rule those are

1.**The Selector**

which identifies the element to be affected (rule applies)

2.**The Declaration**

- made up of a property and a value.
- There could be more than one declaration in a single rule
- Each declaration must end by semicolons.
- very similar to attribute names and their values

## Benefits of CSS

- New looks to your old Html documents.
- Better type and layout controls.
- Less work - change the appearance of an entire site editing one style sheet.

## CSS Selector

A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

- Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
- [Combinator selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_combinators.asp) (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
- [Pseudo-class selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp) (select elements based on a certain state)
- [Pseudo-elements selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_elements.asp) (select and style a part of an element)
- [Attribute selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_attribute_selectors.asp) (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
